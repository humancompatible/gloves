# GLOVES : Global Counterfactual-based Visual Explanations
This repository contains the code for the Demo Paper submission for EDBT 2025.

We introduce Global Counterfactual-based Visual Explanations
(GLOVES), a visualization platform designed to enhance the ex-
plainability of decision-making systems through global counter-
factual explanations (GCE). GLOVES focuses on visualizing global
counterfactuals, calculated on top of a classifierâ€™s decisions on an
examined population, enabling users to explore and compare different configurations of GCE algorithms interactively.

Our tool can be found online at [http://gloves.imsi.athenarc.gr/](http://gloves.imsi.athenarc.gr/).
